## About me

I have been teaching computer science for twenty years, mainly algorithmic and programming. 
Now, I work as a lecturer at [ENSICAEN](https://www.ensicaen.fr/)" (a french national 
graduate school of engineering).

My research activity initially focused on algorithms for image processing and analysis, 
mainly in the medical field. It now extends to the modeling of complex systems such as the 
understanding of biological and physiological mechanisms.

My other interests are in the areas of biology, ancient and medieval history, and geopolitics.
